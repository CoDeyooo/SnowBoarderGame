This project is part of the [2D Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) however I made some small tweaks like adding sound when gliding and making my own particle effects.

<h2>With this project I learned how to:</h2>


<h3>Use Unity's particle system</h3>


<h3>How to use a virtual camera that follows the player</h3>


<h3>How to use a Surface Effector 2D</h3>


<h3>How to reload a level</h3>
